    src/output/biology_diagnostics.jl

Cohort-level diagnostics for the larval biology that the main figure set did not cover.

The particle-tracking model computes several quantities that were previously only embedded in the
interactive HTML payload and never drawn as a figure, which made the stage model hard to check:

- `cohort_molt_fraction` — the fraction of the cohort that has completed each transition, on the
  same 0-to-1 scale as the per-larva developmental quantiles;
- `degree_days_timeseries` — the thermal time each larva accumulated within its current stage,
  which is the x-axis on which every stage transition is defined;
- `temperatures` — the temperature history the larvae were advected through;
- `survival_probability` and `stage_survival` — cohort survival and the fraction alive at each
  stage transition;
- the resolved `molt_schedule` — the three threshold CDFs themselves.

Together these let the stage model be verified from the output rather than inferred from it.

    plot_molt_progression(trajs; output_path, title)

Diagnostic for the quantile/CDF stage model: how the cohort advances through Zoea I -> Zoea II ->
Megalopa -> Instar I over the simulated period.

# Panels
1. **Cohort transition fractions** — `cohort_molt_fraction` against time, one curve per
   transition, on a 0-to-1 axis. This is the fraction of the cohort that has COMPLETED each
   transition, read from the stage each larva reached.
2. **Realised stage composition** — the fraction of the cohort in each stage over time, as stacked
   bands. Panel 1 is the running count of the same thing: a cohort fraction that has completed a
   transition matches the fraction of larvae at or beyond that stage.
3. **Developmental quantile spread** — molting degree-day against developmental quantile `u` for a
   sample of particles, with the resolved schedule's mean thresholds marked. Confirms the
   ordering (small `u` moults early) and the shape of the distribution.

The thresholds marked in panel 3 are read from the run's own resolved schedule, so the figure
describes the model that ran rather than a set of numbers written into the plotting code.

    plot_degree_day_growth(trajs; output_path, title)

Thermal degree-days accumulated by each larva, against time, with the stage thresholds marked.

This is the x-axis of the whole stage model — every transition is defined on it — so a run whose
curves stay flat has larvae that never develop, and one whose curves diverge is doing so because
larvae saw different temperatures.

The accumulation is PER STAGE and resets at each ecdysis, so a curve that reaches a threshold and
drops back to zero is a larva that has MOULTED, not one that lost its thermal history. The
thresholds marked are read from the run's own resolved schedule.

1. **Survival probability** — `survival_probability` per larva over time, plus the cohort mean. In

2. **Settlement and mortality outcome** — how the cohort ended, as a single stacked bar. Distinguishes
   settled, still pelagic, and dead, which no other figure reports directly.
3. **Stage-transition survival** — `stage_survival`, the fraction of each cohort still alive at the
   moment it changed stage, as a bar per transition. A large drop at a transition indicates
   stage-specific mortality not captured by the background rate.
