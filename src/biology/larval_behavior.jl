    lognormal_sigma(cv::Real) -> Float64

Convert a coefficient of variation into the log-scale standard deviation of a
lognormal, `σ = sqrt(log(1 + cv²))`.

A lognormal is used rather than a Normal because all the quantities being
dispersed here — developmental rates, mortality rates — are strictly positive and
right-skewed, which is how biological rates actually behave. A Normal must be
clamped at zero, and the clamp is not a harmless detail: it piles a point mass on
the boundary. Measured on the molt threshold at 200 000 draws, `cv = 0.5` put
**2.4 %** of larvae at exactly the 1.0 degree-day floor and `cv = 0.75` put
**9.5 %** there, i.e. cohorts of larvae that molt instantaneously. A lognormal is
positive by construction, so there is nothing to clamp and no such artifact.

Draw a positive, right-skewed value with population mean `base` and coefficient

Parameterisation is mean-preserving: `σ = sqrt(log(1 + cv²))` and the draw is
`base * exp(σ·z − σ²/2)` with `z ~ Normal(0,1)`, so `E[draw] = base` and
`CV[draw] = cv` exactly. The `−σ²/2` term is what shifts the lognormal's median
below its mean; omitting it would make the mean `base·exp(σ²/2)`, i.e. turning a
`cv` up would also raise the expected rate.

At `cv == 0` the result is exactly `base`.

    draw_beta_index(base::Real, cv::Real, rng; min_concentration = 0.05) -> Float64

Draw a value in `(0, 1)` representing a **bounded suitability index**, with population mean `base`
and coefficient of variation `cv`.

A suitability index is a probability-like quantity confined to `[0, 1]`, so neither dispersion used
elsewhere in this file applies to it:

* a **lognormal** has the wrong support — it is unbounded above, and a suitability index above 1 is
  not a slightly optimistic index, it is an invalid one;
* a **clipped Normal** is not mean preserving. At the optimum (`base = 1`) roughly half the mass
  falls above 1 and is clipped to exactly 1 while the rest is clipped down, so the *expected*
  acceptance is pushed below `base`. Turning `cv_settlement` up would then silently **reduce**
  settlement — a dispersion knob changing the mean.

A **Beta** is the standard choice for a bounded index with a controllable mean and dispersion, and
it is the only one of the three that hits the requested mean *and* CV exactly. For
`Beta(α, β)` with mean `μ` and concentration `κ = α + β`:

    mean = μ,   var = μ(1 − μ) / (κ + 1)   ⟹   κ = (1 − μ)/(μ·cv²) − 1

and the shapes follow as `α = μκ`, `β = (1 − μ)κ`.

**Feasibility limit.** A variable on `[0, 1]` has `var ≤ μ(1 − μ)`, so a bounded index of mean `μ`
cannot have a CV larger than `sqrt((1 − μ)/μ)` — 0.33 at `μ = 0.9`, 1.0 at `μ = 0.5`, 3.0 at
`μ = 0.1`. This is a property of the interval, not a modelling choice: asking for `cv = 0.5` on an
index of 0.9 means a substantial fraction of cases must sit at 0. `κ` is floored at
`min_concentration` so such a request degrades to a near-Bernoulli draw instead of producing a
negative concentration, and the mean is still preserved. Worth knowing when reading results: at a
high `μ` the effective CV saturates below the requested one.

`base` of exactly 0 or 1 is returned unchanged, so the unsuitability gate and the optimum are
respected exactly. `cv = 0` returns `base` unchanged.

Compute active post-hatch vertical ascent velocity \$w_{\\text{ascent}}(z)\$ for
newly hatched snow crab larvae (*Chionoecetes opilio*) rising from benthic hatching
grounds on the ocean floor to the epipelagic surface mixed layer.

# Mathematical & Biological Formulation
Ovigerous female snow crabs dwell on the seabed (\$z_{\\text{bed}}\$) and release
larvae into near-bottom waters during the spring phytoplankton bloom (Lovrich et al.,
1995; Sainte-Marie & Sainte-Marie, 1999). Newly hatched Stage I zoeae exhibit strong
negative geotaxis (active upward swimming against gravity) and positive phototaxis
(Sulkin, 1984; Forward, 1988).

The active upward swimming velocity \$w_{\\text{ascent}}(z)\$ directed toward the
productive surface mixed layer (\$z_{\\text{target}}\$) is parameterized via a
hyperbolic tangent transition scale:
```math
w_{\\text{ascent}}(z) = w_{\\text{ascent,max}} \\tanh\\left(
    \\frac{z_{\\text{target}} - z}{L_{\\text{relax}}}
\\right)
```
where \$w_{\\text{ascent,max}}\$ is the maximum directed ascent speed (typically
\$0.008\\text{--}0.015\\text{ m s}^{-1} \\approx 8\\text{--}15\\text{ mm s}^{-1}\$),
\$z_{\\text{target}}\$ is the upper euphotic/mixed layer depth (default \$-10.0\\text{ m}\$),
and \$L_{\\text{relax}}\$ is the vertical relaxation scale (default \$10.0\\text{ m}\$).
Deep in the water column (\$z \\ll z_{\\text{target}}\$), \$\\tanh \\approx 1.0\$,
providing sustained upward swimming. As the larva nears the surface target,
the velocity smoothly decelerates to zero.

# Inputs

- `z_surface_target::Real`: Target epipelagic depth in meters (default -10.0 m).

Compute active vertical swimming velocity \$w_{\\text{swim}}(z, t)\$ for snow crab
larvae undergoing stage-dependent Diel Vertical Migration (DVM) or initial post-hatch
ascent from benthic spawning grounds.

# Mathematical & Ecological Model
Snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*) larvae exhibit stage-dependent vertical
positioning (Incze et al., 1987; Lovrich et al., 1995; Sainte-Marie & Sainte-Marie, 1999).
When `initial_ascent = true`, newly released larvae swim actively upward toward the
surface mixed layer at speed `ascent_speed` via `larval_ascent_velocity`.
Once established in the pelagic zone (`initial_ascent = false`), planktonic Zoea I and II
stages occupy shallower depths at night and migrate to deeper, colder layers during the day.
Semiplanktonic Megalopa larvae actively seek benthic nursery grounds prior to settlement.

The instantaneous target depth \$z_{\\text{target}}(t)\$ over a 24-hour diurnal
cycle (\$T = 86400\\text{ s}\$) is:
```math
z_{\\text{target}}(t) = \\frac{z_{\\text{day}} + z_{\\text{night}}}{2}
- \\frac{z_{\\text{night}} - z_{\\text{day}}}{2} \\cos\\left( \\frac{2\\pi t}{86400} \\right)
```
The active swimming velocity \$w_{\\text{swim}}(z, t)\$ is:
```math
w_{\\text{swim}}(z, t) = w_{\\max} \\tanh\\left( \\frac{z_{\\text{target}}(t) - z}{L_{\\text{relax}}} \\right)
```

Draw one particle's cumulative degree-day thresholds for the three stage transitions.

**Dispersion is applied to the stage increments, not to the cumulative thresholds.** The base
thresholds are decomposed into the increments needed to pass through them,
`(b₁, b₂ − b₁, b₃ − b₂)` — for the defaults `(65, 65, 70)` degree-days — each increment is drawn
from a mean-preserving lognormal, and the thresholds are the running sums:

```math
t_1 = \\Delta_1, \\quad t_2 = \\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2, \\quad t_3 = \\Delta_1 + \\Delta_2 + \\Delta_3
```

where `Δₖ = baseₖ · exp(σ·zₖ − σ²/2)`, `σ = sqrt(log(1 + cv_molt²))`, `zₖ ~ Normal(0,1)`.

This construction matters, because the obvious alternatives are both wrong:

* Drawing the **cumulative thresholds** independently and then forcing `t₂ > t₁`, `t₃ > t₂` with
  `max` looks equivalent but is not: the `max` guard propagates a slow-developer tail upward, so
  the mean of `t₃` is inflated (measured: 217 degree-days instead of 200 at `cv = 0.5`, and 234 at
  `cv = 0.75`). `cv_molt` would then be a knob that silently lengthens the expected time to
  settlement instead of only dispersing it.
* Drawing a Normal and clamping at zero piles an artificial spike on the floor — at `cv = 0.5`,
  **2.4 %** of larvae were given a Zoea I duration of about two hours (`cv = 0.75`: 9.5 %).

With increments, **ordering is automatic** (every `Δₖ > 0`), nothing is clamped, and all three
means are preserved exactly: `E[t₁] = b₁`, `E[t₂] = b₂`, `E[t₃] = b₃`. The *total* requirement is
less dispersed than any single stage, which is the correct behaviour — variability averages out
across stages — so the CV of `t₃` is naturally below `cv_molt`.

Because `DD = (T − T_base)·d` for a cohort at fixed temperature, the increment CV is also the stage
duration CV, so published stage-duration dispersion transfers directly.

**These must be drawn once per particle and then reused**, never redrawn per call. A developmental
threshold is a fixed property of the individual larva: redrawing it on every timestep resamples the
developmental rate at random each step, which lets a particle's stage regress (`:zoea2` → `:zoea1`)
and makes settlement competence flicker on and off. See [`update_larval_stage`](@ref).

    MoltCDF

A cumulative distribution over cumulative thermal degree-days describing **when a larva reaches a
developmental threshold**, parameterised by a base mean and a coefficient of variation.

The distribution is a **mean-preserving lognormal**: its arithmetic mean is exactly `base`
degree-days and its coefficient of variation is exactly `cv`, so `cv` is a pure dispersion knob
and raising it never changes the expected development rate. The log-scale parameters are

```math
\\sigma_{\\log} = \\sqrt{\\log(1 + c^2)}, \\qquad
\\mu_{\\log} = \\ln(m) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\sigma_{\\log}^2
```

`c → 0` degenerates continuously to the deterministic point mass at `base`, so the fully
deterministic path is the exact limit of the stochastic one.

This is the mortality analogue of the developmental quantile: one draw per larva, held for life, so
a weak larva faces a raised mortality rate *throughout* its pelagic period rather than being
randomised independently at every timestep. It is the standard **unobserved heterogeneity

`u` near 0 gives a vigorous larva (multiplier < 1, i.e. it outlives the cohort expectation) and

    update_larval_stage(current_stage::Symbol, degree_days::Real, schedule, developmental_u::Real)

Advance a larva's ontogenetic stage from its accumulated thermal degree-days, a **global
per-stage threshold schedule**, and the larva's **developmental quantile**.

A larva moults once the cohort-wide probability of having reached the threshold,
`cdf(schedule[k], degree_days)`, passes its own fixed quantile `developmental_u`. Because
`developmental_u ∈ [0, 1]` is constant and degree-days are non-decreasing, the returned stage is
monotone non-decreasing: a larva can never regress.

`developmental_u` is a **developmental percentile** — a fixed draw from `Uniform(0, 1)` per larva,
reused for all three transitions, so a fast developer stays a fast developer. This models
developmental rate as an individual quality rather than as independent noise at each stage, and
makes the three stage durations rank-correlated for an individual.

!!! note "Direction of the quantile: small `u` is a FAST developer"
    Because a larva moults once the cohort CDF `F(D)` has risen past its own percentile, a **small**
    `u` is a **fast** developer (it moults early) and a **large** `u` is a **slow** one. In the
    default `cv_molt = 0.25` case `u = 0.1` moults at roughly 45 degree-days and `u = 0.9` at
    roughly 92. This is the standard inverse-transform construction: `u` indexes the *threshold*
    distribution, so a high percentile is a high requirement. If you want the opposite sense
    (large `u` = fast), draw `1 - rand()` instead; the two are equivalent.

For a monotone CDF this rule is identical to the per-larva threshold rule
(`u ≤ F(d)` ⟺ `d ≥ F⁻¹(u)`); the CDF form is used because it makes the 0-to-1
probability structure explicit and the threshold implicit.

# Mathematical & Ecological Formulation
1. **Depth Suitability Index** \$S_z(z) \\in [0, 1]\$:
   - Optimal nursery depths: \$z \\in [-180, -80]\\text{ m}\$.
   - Tapers to 0 at nearshore surf zone (\$z > -50\\text{ m}\$) and offshore abyss (\$z < -250\\text{ m}\$).
2. **Thermal Suitability Index** \$S_T(T) \\in [0, 1]\$:
   - Optimal Cold Intermediate Layer (CIL) nursery: \$T \\in [0.5, 3.5]^\\circ\\text{C}\$.
   - Tapers to 0 at thermal stress threshold (\$T > 6.0^\\circ\\text{C}\$) and superchilling (\$T < -1.0^\\circ\\text{C}\$).
3. **Combined Habitat Suitability Index**:
   ```math
   \\text{HSI}(z, T) = S_z(z) \\times S_T(T) \\in [0, 1]
   ```
   In stochastic mode, settlement succeeds if \$r \\sim U(0, 1) \\le \\text{HSI}\$.
   In deterministic mode, settlement succeeds if \$\\text{HSI} > 0.0\$.

Initialize an ensemble of snow crab larval particle states across a specified
spawning area, spatial stratum, or extended buffered marine envelope on the
continental shelf. Strict marine water and high-resolution coastline land exclusion
constraints are enforced so that larvae are placed strictly in active marine water
columns and never on emergent land.

# Spatial Buffering & Land Exclusion
1. **User-Defined Buffer Envelope**: When `buffer_km > 0.0` (e.g. default 100 km), the release
   domain is expanded outward by \$\\Delta\\phi = d_{\\text{buf}}/R_{\\text{earth}}\$ and
   \$\\Delta\\lambda = \\Delta\\phi / \\cos(\\phi_0)\$ to capture inflow, upstream advection,
   and transboundary exchange across administrative boundaries.
2. **Stratum & CFA Polygon Seeding**: When `stratum` is provided (e.g. `:cfa4x`, `:cfasouth`,
   `:cfanorth`, or a polygon `NamedTuple`), particles are sampled across the stratum or its
   buffered marine envelope.
3. **Strict Coastline Land Rejection**: For every candidate coordinate, `!is_point_on_land(lon, lat)`
   and \$z_{\\text{bed}} \\le -h_{\\text{min}}\$ are strictly enforced.

# Inputs
- `n_particles::Int`: Total number of particles to release.
- `lon_range::Tuple{Real, Real}`: Longitude release bounds (used if `stratum = nothing`).
- `lat_range::Tuple{Real, Real}`: Latitude release bounds (used if `stratum = nothing`).
- `depth_range::Union{Nothing, Tuple{Real, Real}}`: Depth release bounds in meters (used if
  `release_depth_mode = :range`, default nothing).
- `release_depth_mode::Union{Nothing, Symbol}`: Vertical release mode: `:bottom` (default,
  near seabed), `:range` (within `depth_range`), or `:surface` (near surface mixed layer).
- `bottom_offset::Tuple{Real, Real}`: Vertical elevation range above seabed in meters when
  `release_depth_mode = :bottom` (default (0.5, 3.0) m).
- `ascent_target_depth::Real`: Target epipelagic depth in meters (default -10.0 m).
- `min_seabed_depth::Real`: Minimum water depth in meters (default 100.0 m, min 0.0 m).
- `buffer_km::Real`: Spatial buffer distance in km beyond stratum/domain bounds (default 0.0 km).
- `bathymetry`: Bathymetry source (`NamedTuple` of `elevation`/`lon`/`lat`, a `GeoDataset`,
  an elevation `Function` `(lon, lat) -> z`, or `nothing`).
- `bathymetry_fn`: Alias for `bathymetry`.
- `coastline`: Optional coastline multi-polygon definitions.
- `stratum`: Optional target stratum (`NamedTuple` with `:lons, :lats`, or CFA symbol `:cfa4x`, etc.).
- `stage::Symbol`: Initial stage (`:zoea1`, `:zoea2`, `:megalopa`).
- `max_attempts::Int`: Maximum rejection sampling attempts per particle (default 100000).
- `rng::AbstractRNG`: Random number generator.

# Outputs
- `NamedTuple`: Arrays `(lon, lat, depth, stage, id, degree_days, alive, settlement_status)`.

Calculate total Pelagic Larval Duration (PLD in days) for snow crab (*Chionoecetes opilio*)
from egg hatch to benthic settlement as a function of ambient water temperature.

# Mathematical Formulation
Following empirical rearing models (Sainte-Marie & Sainte-Marie, 1999; Kuhn & Choi, 2011):
```math
\\text{PLD}(T) = a \\cdot (T + t_{\\text{ref}})^{-b}
```

# Inputs
- `temperature_celsius::Real`: Mean ambient water temperature in °C.
- `a::Real`: Empirical scaling constant (default 135.0).
- `b::Real`: Empirical power coefficient (default 0.75).
- `t_ref::Real`: Temperature offset parameter (default 1.0 °C).

# Outputs
- `Float64`: Estimated larval drift duration in days.

Compute the instantaneous daily mortality rate \$\\mu(T)\$ (day⁻¹) for snow crab larvae
accounting for exponential upper warm-water stress and lower cold-water mortality.

# Mathematical Formulation
```math
\\mu(T) = \\mu_{\\text{base}} \\exp\\left( \\beta_{\\text{warm}} \\max(0, T - T_{\\text{warm,crit}}) \\right)
        + \\mu_{\\text{cold}} \\max(0, T_{\\text{cold,crit}} - T)
```

# Calibration Notes
- **Warm stress threshold** \$T_{\\text{warm,crit}} = 7.0^\\circ\\text{C}\$: sub-lethal
  warm-water stress initiates at ≥7°C in *C. opilio* larvae
  (Kuhn & Choi, 2011; Epifanio & Cohen, 2016). Lethal limit ≈9°C.
  The exponential form accurately captures rapid thermal mortality during warm anomalies.
- **Cold stress threshold** \$T_{\\text{cold,crit}} = -1.5^\\circ\\text{C}\$: larvae
  enter dormancy / diapause below ~-1.5°C (Kuhn & Choi, 2011). Linear
  penalty applied to avoid discontinuity at the threshold.

# Inputs
- `temperature_celsius::Real`: Water temperature in °C.
- `base_mortality::Real`: Baseline natural daily mortality rate (default 0.02 day⁻¹).
- `thermal_threshold::Real`: Upper warm-stress onset threshold \$T_{\\text{warm,crit}}\$ (default 7.0 °C).
- `thermal_sensitivity::Real`: Warm-stress exponential coefficient (default 0.35 °C⁻¹).
- `cold_threshold::Real`: Lower cold-stress onset threshold \$T_{\\text{cold,crit}}\$ (default -1.5 °C).
- `cold_sensitivity::Real`: Cold-stress linear coefficient (default 0.02 day⁻¹ °C⁻¹).

# Outputs
- `Float64`: Instantaneous daily mortality rate in \$\\text{day}^{-1}\$.
